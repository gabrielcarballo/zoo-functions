# Zoo Management Project - JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms

This project is a demonstration of my skills in JavaScript, focusing on ES6, Higher Order Functions, and Test-Driven Development (TDD). The goal is to organize information about the zoo's animals and collaborators.

## Project Overview

The project is structured into several JavaScript functions, each fulfilling a specific requirement:

1. **getSpeciesByIds():** Retrieve information about animal species by their IDs and return an array containing all animals of that species.

2. **getAnimalsOlderThan():** Receive a species and an age as parameters, and return whether all animals of that species are older than or equal to the specified age.

3. **getEmployeeByName():** Search for collaborators by their first or last name and return the relevant information.

4. **getRelatedEmployees():** Check if a collaborator is a manager and return information about the people they lead.

5. **countAnimals():** Count the number of different animal species residing in the zoo.

6. **handlerElephants():** Implement tests for this function to achieve at least 80% coverage.

7. **calculateEntry():** Calculate the total entry fee for zoo visitors.

8. **getSchedule():** Provide a schedule with visiting hours for each animal species during the week.

9. **getOldestFromFirstSpecies():** Find the oldest animal in the species managed by a collaborator.

10. **getEmployeesCoverage():** Return information about collaborators and the animal species they are responsible for.

11. **getOpeningHours():** Implement tests for this function to achieve at least 85% coverage.

12. **getAnimalMap():** Create a geographical map of animals by species, with options for location filtering, alphabetical order by name, and filtering by gender.

## Project Requirements

The project adheres to the requirements outlined in the bootcamp project readme. It has been developed with a focus on ES6 and Test-Driven Development.

## Development

During development, follow the provided guidelines, including addressing linting issues, implementing tests, and achieving specified coverage percentages. Additionally, utilize the existing project structure, with key files in the src, test, evaluator, and data folders.
